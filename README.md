# 🎮 BloxdVR

**BloxdVR** is a custom, community-driven virtual reality project that brings the world of [Bloxd.io](https://bloxd.io) into a fully immersive VR experience. This project serves as a VR client and toolkit, enabling head tracking, VR controls, and a true 3D camera view for Bloxd players.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** BloxdVR is an **unofficial** third-party project and is not affiliated with the official Bloxd.io developers. It is part of the custom development ecosystem including **IQBloxd**, **VBloxd**, and **VRBloxd**.

## ✨ Features
